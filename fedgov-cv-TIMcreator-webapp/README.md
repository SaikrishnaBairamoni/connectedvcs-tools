# Connected Vehicles TIM Creator Webapp Project

## Overview

The fedgov-cv-TIMcreator-webapp project is a webapp that allows users to build traveler information messages regarding sign and work zone details using a graphical interface. Once designed, the user can encode a TIM message as an ASN.1 UPER Hex string and deposit it to the SDW warehouse.
